# 🚗 Self-Driving Car Simulation (Build-in-Public)

A self-driving car simulation built **from scratch in JavaScript** to understand how **Neural Networks actually make decisions** — not just theory, but behavior.

This project focuses on **visualization, learning, and decision-making**, not libraries.

---

## ✨ Why this project

While learning Neural Networks, I wanted to *see* how weights, biases, and sensors turn into actions.
So instead of notebooks, I built a simulation.

## 🧠 What’s inside

### Perception

* Ray-casting sensors (distance readings)
* Road borders + traffic detection

### Decision Making

* Custom Neural Network implementation
* Weights, biases, feed-forward logic
* Binary & continuous control signals

### Learning

* Genetic mutation (evolution-style learning)
* Fitness based on distance + survival
* Best brain persistence using `localStorage`

### Environment

* Infinite road illusion
* Dynamic traffic spawning
* Lane-aware traffic (no impossible blocks)
* Collision detection

### Visualization

* Real-time neural network graph
* Color-coded weights & activations
* Sensor rays + hit points

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* Vanilla **JavaScript**
* HTML5 **Canvas**
* No ML libraries
* No physics engines

---

## ▶ How to run

1. Clone the repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Watch the AI learn and improve

(No build step required)

---

## 📊 What this demonstrates

* How inputs are transformed into actions
* Why biases matter
* How simple models can learn complex behavior
* Trade-offs between rule-based logic and learning

---

## 🔮 Planned extensions

* Full map with intersections
* Traffic lights & right-of-way rules
* Path planning (A*/Dijkstra)
* Multi-agent coordination
* Performance metrics & evaluation

## 🧩 Key takeaway

> AI isn’t magic — it’s math, feedback, and iteration.

This project helped me understand **how learning systems behave**, not just how they’re defined.
